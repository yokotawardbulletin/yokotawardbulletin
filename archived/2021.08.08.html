      <h3><i>"Whatever your struggle, my brothers and sisters — mental or emotional or physical or otherwise — do not vote against the preciousness of life by ending it! Trust in God. Hold on in His love. Know that one day the dawn will break brightly and all shadows of mortality will flee. Though we may feel we are 'like a broken vessel,'' as the Psalmist says, we must remember, that vessel is in the hands of the divine potter. Broken minds can be healed just the way broken bones and broken hearts are healed. While God is at work making those repairs, the rest of us can help by being merciful, nonjudgmental, and kind."</i></h3>

      <p><i>July - </i> Dear Brothers and Sisters,</p>
      <p>I would like to share with you some of my favorite quotes from President Russell M. Nelson that he taught us at the last general conference:</p>
      <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">(Click here to hide or show quotes)
        <li><i>“The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of repentance. Because of the Savior’s Atonement, His gospel provides an invitation to keep changing, growing, and becoming more pure. It is a gospel of hope, of healing, and of progress. Thus, the gospel is a message of joy! Our spirits rejoice with every small step forward we take.”</i></li>
        <li><i>“I have thought about the need for each of us to remove, with the Savior’s help, the old debris in our lives. I invite you to pray to identify the debris you should remove from your life so you can become more worthy.”</i></li>
        <li><i>“You may feel that there is still more you need to do to make your home truly a sanctuary of faith. If so, please do it!  There are few pursuits more important than this. Between now and the time the Lord comes again, we all need our homes to be places of serenity and security.”</i></li>
        <li><i>“Your commitment to make your home your primary sanctuary of faith should never end. As faith and holiness decrease in this fallen world, your need for holy places will increase. I urge you to continue to make your home a truly holy place ‘and be not moved’ from that essential goal.”</i></li>
        <li><i>“If you know of anyone who is alone, reach out—even if you feel alone too!  You do not need to have a reason or a message or business to transact. Just say hello and show your love. Technology can help you. Pandemic or not, each precious child of God needs to know that he or she is not alone!”</i></li>
        <li><i>“We can use our time to hear the voice of the Lord whispering His guidance, comfort, and peace. Quiet time is sacred time—time that will facilitate personal revelation and instill peace.  Discipline yourself to have time alone and with your loved ones. Open your heart to God in prayer. Take time to immerse yourself in the scriptures and worship in the temple.”</i></li>
        <li><i>“Each of God’s children deserves the opportunity to hear and accept the healing, redeeming message of Jesus Christ. No other message is more vital to our happiness—now and forever. No message is more filled with hope. No other message can eliminate contention in our society.”</i></li>
        <li><i>“Everything good in life—every potential blessing of eternal significance—begins with faith. Allowing God to prevail in our lives begins with faith that He is willing to guide us. True repentance begins with faith that Jesus Christ has the power to cleanse, heal, and strengthen us."</i></li>
        <li><i>“The Lord does not require perfect faith for us to have access to His perfect power. But He does ask us to believe.”</i></li>
        <li><i>“My dear brothers and sisters, my call to you is to start today to increase your faith. Through your faith, Jesus Christ will increase your ability to move the mountains in your life, even though your personal challenges may loom as large as Mount Everest.”</i></li>
        <li><i>“Faith in Jesus Christ is the greatest power available to us in this life.  All things are possible to them that believe.”</i></li>
        <li><i>“I love you, my dear brothers and sisters, and testify that our Heavenly Father and His beloved Son know and love you individually. They stand ready to assist you in every step forward you take.”</i></li>
      </ul>
      <p>I know that President Russell M. Nelson is a prophet of God, and that he conveys to us the mind and will of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  May we internalize and heed his teachings.</p>
      <p>- Brother Ammon Hardy, Yokota Ward Bishopric</p>
      <h3>Message from the Stake Presidency</h3>
      <p>The Stake Presidency has sent a letter to all members of the Tokyo South (English) Stake. You are encouraged to read and ponder its message as a family.

If you need keys to access the building, contact Brother Michael Moore or anyone in the bishopric.</p>
      <p>General Conference Changes: Starting with this October's conference and going forward, the church will discontinue the Saturday evening sessions. Previously, the church held Saturday evening session for women (the women's session) and men (the priesthood session). <i>"This change is being made because all sessions of General Conference are now available to anyone who desires to watch or listen."</i></p>

      <p>Starting from today, read 7 days without missing a day and I will give the primary kids a piece of candy on Sunday every week they complete the challenge.  If they can’t have candy I can also do a small 3D printed prize.  I’m trying to help the primary kids form a habit of daily personal scripture reading.  Also 1 verse is the minimum, if they are already reading more than that then don’t slow down or read less, just read AT LEAST 1 verse everyday no matter what.  If you miss a day then start again the next day but try to keep your streak alive.</p>
