      <h3><i>"A cucumber becomes a pickle as it is prepared and cleaned, immersed in and saturated with salt brine, and sealed in a sterilized container. This procedure requires time and cannot be hurried, and none of the essential steps can be ignored or avoided... Just as a cucumber [...we] can be prepared with 'the words of faith and of good doctrine' (1 Timothy 4:6) and initially cleansed through the ordinances and covenants administered by the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood [...we] are born again as we are absorbed by and in the gospel of Jesus Christ... We progressively become purified and sanctified as [we...] receive the ordinances and honor the covenants that are administered by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood."</i></h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB0AylSalFs">Your Great Adventure: Overcoming Life's Obstacles</a>, a message from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>-->
      <p class="new"><b>New!</b> <i>October - </i> Stick with the Program.</p>
      <p class="new">You ever watch a movie where the hero is running into battle against the enemy and people all around him/her are being taken out by arrows/guns/alien weapons etc.  Sometimes I feel like that is what is happening to members of the Church, and specifically our youth and children.  One by one kids/youth are told lies and they decide they don't believe or they stop putting in the effort to figure out if it is all true or not.  And one by one they get taken out of the battle by the adversary. </p>
      <p class="new">So what can we do about it?  How do we raise our kids so this does not happen to them?  Honestly, we do all we can, but at the end of the day they always have their agency.  Several prophets in scripture had children go astray and I’m sure they were better parents than I will ever be.  I’m looking at you, Lehi.  So as I try to figure this out, I come to this conclusion:  I just need to follow the program the best I can.  Whats the program?  It’s the things the Lord has asked us to do through his prophets.  Weekly Family Home Evening, Family Council, daily Come Follow Me study as a family, actively working with and helping our kids with the new Children and Youth Program, and helping our kids make a habit of daily personal scripture study.   When do we start? Today.  Kids are never too young to start these habits.  I have been pleasantly surprised by the number of primary kids and youth who have responded to my challenges and are reading their scriptures every day.  I want to further extend that challenge to read at least 1 verse or 1 minute of scripture every day to all the adults in the ward.  However— sorry adults— I don’t have that kind of money, so you won’t get a piece of candy out of the jar if you complete the challenge each week.  But you’re still welcome to come for a piece every now and then.</p>
      <p class="new">Overall, we do what we can and it will not ever be perfect, but that’s ok.  I had my youngest son ask at dinner the other week, “when are we going to do that one thing we used to do where I got up and called on people to do stuff?”  He was talking about family home evening.  We had been doing daily come follow me study as a family and we realized we had started to neglect an official family home evening.  We had to refocus and get back to the program.  As we focus on doing what the Lord has asked and try to set an example for our kids, I think we give them the best shot at achieving happiness in this life and the life to come.  Oh and one more thing— in the movies, once people are taken out they don't get back up.  Thankfully, in real life, you never know what will happen as people can and do get back up and into the fight all the time.  So never give up hope and continue in love.</p>

      <p>Starting from today, read 7 days without missing a day and I will give the primary kids a piece of candy on Sunday every week they complete the challenge.  If they can’t have candy I can also do a small 3D printed prize.  I’m trying to help the primary kids form a habit of daily personal scripture reading.  Also 1 verse is the minimum, if they are already reading more than that then don’t slow down or read less, just read AT LEAST 1 verse everyday no matter what.  If you miss a day then start again the next day but try to keep your streak alive.</p>
      <p> Bishop Larson also challenges youth and adults to read at least one chapter a day in the scriptures.</p>
      <p>Activity Days Boys and Girls are meeting from 6:30-7:45pm on Wednesdays at the church.</p>
