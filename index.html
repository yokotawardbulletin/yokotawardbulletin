      <h3><i>"I believe all confidence, all comfort, all strength, all safety starts here - 'This I Know; ... God is for me <a href="gospellibrary://content/scriptures/ot/ps/56?languageId=1">(Psalms 56:9)</a>.' This truth has to be seared into our hearts, written in bold letters across the tissue of our brains, and never forgotten... we will find ourselves better prepared to carry on in the face of difficulty, to go forward with true faith, if we can hold to a few rock-solid principles that will undergird us on our way. The very first of those, the most fundamental of all, must be that God lives and does love us - that He is for us. And as the Apostle Paul would later ask, 'If God be for us, who [or we might add, what] can be against us?... We are more than conquerors through him that loved us <a href="gospellibrary://content/scriptures/nt/rom/8?languageId=1"> (Romans 8:31, 37)</a>.'"</i></h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB0AylSalFs">Your Great Adventure: Overcoming Life's Obstacles</a>, a message from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
      <p><i>June - </i> Don't get discouraged. 
        <br><br>I try to be a very goal oriented person, because I feel like Christ is trying to teach us to be more goal oriented with the new children and youth program.  As I talk with many members of the ward I sometimes see discouragement. It’s easy to set high goals and then get discouraged when we aren’t meeting them.  Or to be discouraged because they require too much effort to reach.  Discouragement won’t help, it will only hinder.  We need all of the positive reinforcement we can get! So remember that when you are setting your goals, make sure that they are realistic and attainable.  Start with small steps, and then adjust your goals as needed along the way.  And then celebrate those victories!  I have challenged the youth and primary to read at least 1 scripture a day.  We have asked the ward as a whole to focus on showing Christ-like love by inviting.  I asked the Ward to focusing on having consistent, easy temple and family history experiences. This is the way.  
        <br><br>Since a critical part of setting goals is re-evaluating the goals and determining how you can make them better or more realistic, I would like to share a few ideas to hopefully make your goals a little more focused.  First off, remember the goals are there to help us grow.  They are not there just to set some arbitrary bar of achievement.  With that being said, don’t worry about numbers too much. Remember that Christ is merciful, he knows our hearts, he knows our intentions.  Let me elaborate on this one a little in regards to the Primary children’s recent goal to read their scriptures every day during the week—let the kids decide if they have done it or not.  If the kids forget one day because they fell asleep early (but don’t remember not reading) its better to reinforce that they are trying.  We are trying to be encouraging not discouraging.  So just ask them and if they say (or think) they read every day then send them up for their prize.    If they know they didn't read 7 days then maybe encourage them to try again next week.  A sunbeam does not have the best concept of time so if they think they read every day thats good enough in my book, don’t remind them of the one day they fell asleep on the couch.  I’m not saying have them lie, but just let them determine on their own if they reached the goal or not. Lets reinforce those good behaviors as much as we can, and just congratulate them for reading every day.  Let them ride that positive behavior momentum!  So as Nephi put it “cheer up your hearts, and remember that ye are free to act for yourselves” <a href="gospellibrary://content/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/10?languageId=1">(2 Nephi 10:23)</a>. The most important part of a goal is the celebration.  The temple picture hearts and the candy are designed to be a celebration of the accomplished goal.  Sometimes we need to look back and see the progress we have made and the celebration helps us accomplish that.  Don't forget to celebrate the progress your kids are making with their goals.  If we never take time to celebrate we might miss the positive gradual change that is taking place and they could get discouraged.    As President Nelson said “The wise use of your freedom to make your own decisions is crucial to your spiritual growth, now and for eternity.  You are never too young to learn, never too old to change.  Your yearnings to learn and change come from a divinely instilled striving for eternal progression.  Each day brings opportunity for decision for eternity."</p>
      <p>- Bishop Nathan Larson</p>

      <p>Starting from today, read 7 days without missing a day and I will give the primary kids a piece of candy on Sunday every week they complete the challenge.  If they can’t have candy I can also do a small 3D printed prize.  I’m trying to help the primary kids form a habit of daily personal scripture reading.  Also 1 verse is the minimum, if they are already reading more than that then don’t slow down or read less, just read AT LEAST 1 verse everyday no matter what.  If you miss a day then start again the next day but try to keep your streak alive.</p>
