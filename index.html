      <p><i>May - </i> I believe our ward has some of the most amazing women in the whole church.  The spirit of service and love that I see in all of you is remarkable.  Mother’s Day is a special holiday in that everyone has a mother, either on this side or the other side of the veil.  Take the time to reach out to those special women in your life and say thank you.  I am grateful for the mothers and women of this ward, you are instrumental in the work of the Lord.  If I could have one wish today it would be that women could see themselves as Christ sees them.  Please know you are genuinely loved and appreciated.</p>

      <p>Starting from today, read 7 days without missing a day and I will give the primary kids a piece of candy on Sunday every week they complete the challenge.  If they can’t have candy I can also do a small 3D printed prize.  I’m trying to help the primary kids form a habit of daily personal scripture reading.  Also 1 verse is the minimum, if they are already reading more than that then don’t slow down or read less, just read AT LEAST 1 verse everyday no matter what.  If you miss a day then start again the next day but try to keep your streak alive.</p>
