      <h3><i>"Whatever your struggle, my brothers and sisters — mental or emotional or physical or otherwise — do not vote against the preciousness of life by ending it! Trust in God. Hold on in His love. Know that one day the dawn will break brightly and all shadows of mortality will flee. Though we may feel we are 'like a broken vessel,'' as the Psalmist says, we must remember, that vessel is in the hands of the divine potter. Broken minds can be healed just the way broken bones and broken hearts are healed. While God is at work making those repairs, the rest of us can help by being merciful, nonjudgmental, and kind."</i></h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB0AylSalFs">Your Great Adventure: Overcoming Life's Obstacles</a>, a message from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>-->
      <p><i>August - </i> Reach out in love.</p>
      <p>With all the new incoming families in the ward and COVID 1 hour half church for the past year I would say more than half the people in the ward don’t know who is new and who has been here for a while.  It’s hard moving to a new place or coming back to a familiar place only to find that so much has changed.  When I send my kids to a new school I hope so much that they will find someone to be their friend, I hope that they will not feel alone.  I imagine that is how Heavenly Father feels about his kids too as they enter his church for the first time.  That is probably why Christ said that the second great commandment is to love our neighbor.  One of the best ways to let people feel loved is by helping them feel like they belong.  <a href="https://youtu.be/SHq1HCiDbCI">We are all searching for belonging (follow this link for Elder D. Todd Christoffersons video “Is there a place for me?</a> We are taught “Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us” (Rom 15:7).</p>
      <p>Now here is the neat part, as we feel like we belong, we each add to and make the whole of the ward better with our individual differences and talents.  We don’t want the same “type of person” in the church we need our differences as that is what makes us stronger and better together.  Each member makes us a better ward.</p>
      <p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught, “It is an immensely satisfying thing to be needed in the body of Christ. Whether I function as an eye or arm is irrelevant; the fact is I am needed in this most majestic organism, and the body is imperfect without me. A popular singer made a small fortune reminding us that “people who need people are the luckiest people in the world.” In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints﻿—the restored ecclesiastical body of Christ﻿—people do need people and everyone is welcomed. This includes (in Paul’s assertion) not only the attractive, talented, “comely” members, but those of us who seem to have fewer gifts and face greater challenges, those who receive less honor and attention. In the Church of Jesus Christ “more abundant honor” is given to these. Every member matters, and the less favored member most of all (see 1 Cor. 12:23–24).”</p>
      <p>So I would challenge you to reach out to someone you don’t know today and just get to know at least one new person a week for the next month (or two).  Don’t wait for people to come to you but seek out those on the periphery or those that are most different from yourself.  And I think we will all find how much everyone is needed in Christ’s Church.</p>
      <p>With Much Love - Bishop Nate Larson, Yokota Ward Bishopric</p>

      <p>Starting from today, read 7 days without missing a day and I will give the primary kids a piece of candy on Sunday every week they complete the challenge.  If they can’t have candy I can also do a small 3D printed prize.  I’m trying to help the primary kids form a habit of daily personal scripture reading.  Also 1 verse is the minimum, if they are already reading more than that then don’t slow down or read less, just read AT LEAST 1 verse everyday no matter what.  If you miss a day then start again the next day but try to keep your streak alive.</p>
      <p>Activity Days Boys and Girls are meeting from 6:30-7:45pm on Wednesdays at the church.</p>
