      <h3>Today: Priesthood and Relief Society</h3>
      <p>The Priesthood reviewed the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O04TI6uL_w&feature=youtu.be">Japan Country Wide Devotional</a> that aired September 6th. Their review occured yesterday at noon, but you are invited to pay special attention to the message given by President Oaks (beginning at 57:00:00 mark).</p>

      <h3>Message from the Bishop</h3>
      <p><i>28 September - </i>Hey I came across this article this week and I really wanted to share it. Sometimes it's hard to get children to love the scriptures but I thought this article had some great ways to engage your children with the scriptures.</p>
      <p>Click the link to read the article, <a href="https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.churchofjesuschrist.org%2Fyouth%2Fchildrenandyouth%2Fparenting%2Fhelping-children-love-the-scriptures&h=AT2mYymqdFMYuJ0JAkKRwldau4RvpyHnJE5GEZcr9vYS_Uy0MvV0PXG6npuLXo8wiFiiSGaGVPfPCCgcwSFenhGN5Jh5LNP9Pmd1fgEemEOSCtxvdmDmu5ZYBMQzCN-p4L4">Helping Children Love the Scriptures</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <p><i>20 September - </i>I just wanted to share with you all a quote from President Cook (our Stake President) <i>"You have been called at this time and at this specific location because of the unique talents and capabilities the Lord has given you.  At times it may be easy to think that we are in a particular place and time because of a job, an opportunity or some other reason.  The Lord though oversees all.  It is He who has opened the pathway for unique opportunities that only you can accomplish in this place and during this time in Japan."</i></p>
      <p>I wanted to testify that I know this to be true, there are so many examples of this in our own ward.  So reach out and magnify your callings or find a small way to serve someone this week and I promise you will see amazing things happen.</p>
