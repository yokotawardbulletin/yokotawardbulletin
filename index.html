      <h2>Sacrament Meeting Theme: Listening to Apostels and Prophets - Why its Important</h2>
      <h3><i>"There are times when the Lord reveals to us things that are intended only for us. Nevertheless, in many, many cases He entrusts a testimony of the truth to those who will share it with others. This has been the case with every prophet since the days of Adam. Even more, the Lord expects the members of His Church to 'open [their mouths] at all times, declaring [His] gospel with the sound of rejoicing.'"</i></h3>

      <p>This talk has also been made into an <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/video/2012-01-0003-waiting-on-our-road-to-damascus?lang=eng">Inspirational Message</a>, though this message is focused on an earlier portion of the talk.

      <h2>Sunday School and Auxiliaries</h2>
      <h3>Today: "Japan Countrywide Devotional"</h3>
      <p>View the Japan Countrywide Devotional at 10:00am - 11:30am JST. The invitation from the Area Presidency reads: <i>"As an Area Presidency, we are happy to announce that we will welcome our beloved brethren, President Dallin H. Oaks, Elder Gerrit W. Gong, and Elder Robert C. Gay to our area for member devotionals. It is our tradition to welcome brethren from Salt Lake City to our area at this time of year, when we are blessed to meet with them in person at our meetinghouses. Unfortunately, that isn’t feasible at this time as borders have not yet completely opened. To this end, they would like to meet virtually to share their testimonies with you of God’s love for each of us."</i></p>
      <p>Watch on the <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/broadcasts/watch/japan-member-devotional/2020/09?lang=eng">Church of Jesus Christ Event Page</a> or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlgzuyJHViY&ab_channel=%E6%9C%AB%E6%97%A5%E8%81%96%E5%BE%92%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A8%E3%82%B9%E3%83%BB%E3%82%AD%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%88%E6%95%99%E4%BC%9A">Youtube</a>.

      <h2>Bishop's Corner</h2>
      <!--<h3>Ward Goals</h3>
      <p>This corner is currently undergoing renovations. Please check back soon.</p>-->
      <h3>Message from the Bishop</h3>
      <p>I just wanted to share with you all a quote from President Cook (our Stake President) <i>"You have been called at this time and at this specific location because of the unique talents and capabilities the Lord has given you.  At times it may be easy to think that we are in a particular place and time because of a job, an opportunity or some other reason.  The Lord though oversees all.  It is He who has opened the pathway for unique opportunities that only you can accomplish in this place and during this time in Japan."</i></p>
      <p>I wanted to testify that I know this to be true, there are so many examples of this in our own ward.  So reach out and magnify your callings or find a small way to serve someone this week and I promise you will see amazing things happen.</p>
