      <h2>Sacrament Meeting Theme: Diligence</h2>
      <h3><i>"I usually place a quote here, with a link to the talk or video it came from, but this week, I wanted to share my testimony and my gratitude. I am grateful for my calling, where I get to design the ward bulletin and share it with all of you, and I'm grateful for it for a few reasons. I get to stay connected with what is happening in the ward. I always know about upcoming events. I am stretched technically as I try to find ways to improve with limited training and resources. I get to be of service. And, I get to search, really really search, for the right scripture or talk to share, which always helps me to pause and listen to the spirit. In whatever calling we have, however big or small and however often it is or isn't noticed by others, we receive a chance to work with the savior on behalf of others and we are asked to pause and listen to the spirit guide us. I wanted to share my testimony at the start of this new year, that just as the Savior is the head of this church, He can steer our lives through any storm, and though He may not always calm the tumultuous seas in our lives, He will lift us up to walk safely on the water of our afflictions we struggled hopelessly against on our own. I hope that anyone reading this believes me when I say I know my Redeemer lives, and He is there for all of us this year and every year to come, as He has been for all mankind every year past, and the enabling power of His living Atonement can strengthen us far beyond our imaginings and beyond the reach of every adversity."</i></h3>

      <h2>Bishop's Corner</h2>
      <!--<h3>Ward Goals</h3>
      <p>This corner is currently undergoing renovations. Please check back soon.</p>-->
      <h3>Message from the Bishop</h3>
      <p><i>3 January - </i> The beginning of a new year gives us a great opportunity to take a step back and reprioritize our efforts.  I would like to suggest two areas in which to focus as we do so.  One is the children and youth program.  In a FAQ letter sent out by the church, it states “Youth are encouraged to complete at least two goals in each of the four areas each year.” Take a moment and ask yourself—did we do this in our family?  I know we didn’t quite make it in my own family.  But don’t forget to celebrate the successes!  An essential part of completing a goal is the celebration!  A little positive reinforcement to let our youth know and see that they are making progress.  Just like we used to have a court of honor a few times a year, we should still have a family court of honor to celebrate the progress our youth are making on their goals. </p>
      <p>The second area of focus that I would like to suggest is inspired by President Nelson’s statement: “I encourage you to take the necessary steps to hear the Lord better and more often so that you can receive the enlightenment He wants to give you.” One of the simple ways that we can do this is to increase our exposure to gospel media.  So I would challenge the Ward to increase your access to gospel related media this week.  This can be done in a number of ways.  You can turn on notifications for all the apps that have been released by the church.  I recently downloaded the church news app and I have gotten several notifications that have interested me enough to drop what I was doing to read the story.  Please don’t confuse this with me encouraging everyone to spend more time on social media.  However, if notifications from Facebook or the News are already bombarding your daily life, consider actively switching out the types of notifications you are seeing—making an effort to be notified by spiritually uplifting media.  I used to get notifications about news stories or being tagged on facebook, and while these were good I would rather read about something the prophet or an apostle said, or read about happenings in the church.  Another simple way to do this would be to sign up for emails from the church—their newsletters are short and they always have excellent and timely articles.  You can easily sign up for those on <a href="https://account.churchofjesuschrist.org/unsubscribe?id=lZg1Pmx5rJg1HFgJD9nqZyOH2T7Va2GpYKGswQhB9pw%3d&type=2&lang=eng">churchofjesuschrist.org</a>.  If you are big into Youtube you can make sure you subscribe to the church’s youth YouTube channel #strivetobe, or maybe the church’s main YouTube channel and turn on notifications for those channels.  If facebook is your jam you can make sure that the prophet and apostles posts will come across your feed.  Or better yet you could browse the feed on the Gospel Living app and see if there is anything that interests you before you open Facebook.  Try to make it a rule or form a habit to check the Gospel Living feed before opening your Facebook feed.  And lastly, you could read the bishop’s message in the ward bulletin every two weeks for the rest of the year.  I would recommend this one the most 😉. </p>
      <p>Hopefully you have noticed a theme that all of these are small and simple efforts that can be easily incorporated into what you are already doing.  However, they also require a little diligence once the change has been made to actually get the full benefit.  I love you all and I know that despite the upcoming challenges we will face this year we can continue to find peace in Christ.</p>
