      <h2>Sacrament Meeting Theme: Fast and Testimony Meeting</h2>
      <h3><i>"There are times when the Lord reveals to us things that are intended only for us. Nevertheless, in many, many cases He entrusts a testimony of the truth to those who will share it with others. This has been the case with every prophet since the days of Adam. Even more, the Lord expects the members of His Church to 'open [their mouths] at all times, declaring [His] gospel with the sound of rejoicing.'"</i></h3>

      <p>This talk has also been made into an <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/video/2012-01-0003-waiting-on-our-road-to-damascus?lang=eng">Inspirational Message</a>, though this message is focused on an earlier portion of the talk.

      <h3>Ward Goals</h3>
      <p>This corner is currently undergoing renovations. Please check back soon.</p>
      <h3>Message from the Bishop</h3>
      <p>COME AS YOU ARE 🙂 </p>
      <br>
      <p>We have a lot of new people in the ward, and there are a lot of new faces. I just wanted to take the time to invite everyone that attends a zoom meeting to turn on your camera. When I thought about why i have left my camera off in the past, it’s almost always because i was not dressed up so I didn’t want people to see me. Now i want to be very clear—we are a come as you are, “no judgment zone” ward. It does not matter if you are dressed up or are wearing sweat pants or basketball shorts, we invite all to be seen. We want to see your smiling faces more than we care about what you look like. I would only ask that you have some clothes on, we don’t want anyone appearing on camera in their skimpies’...I’m looking at you Bro Brown 😉. So come as you are, turn on your camera, and lets get to know everyone. This is Christ’s church, after all, and we just want to love and see everyone.</p>
